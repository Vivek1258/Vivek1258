AI Software Engineer with around four years of experience focused on developing high-performance AI inference solutions and scalable cloud systems. My approach is grounded in studies of academic research and open-source contributions, where I developed a deep appreciation for efficient and collaborative engineering. 

Today, I apply that foundation to my work in hardware acceleration, device-aware deployment, and MLOps automation, building AI systems that deliver tangible real-world impact.
