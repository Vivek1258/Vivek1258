- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Vivek Mankar 

- I love developing software applications using technologies like AI and Cloud

- I graduated with a nano degree in Machine Learning Engineering and completed various noncredit extracurricular specialization courses in machine learning. This helped me gain a solid understanding of the basics and mathematics behind ML/DL algorithms.

- I have received a scholarship in Machine learning from Amazon Web Services (AWS). And currently, I am in the Kaggle 2X expert track( Dataset and Code | Top 1% in Dataset Experts Track ).

- I am looking forward to developing my skills in Cloud technology and contributing to interesting open-source projects.
