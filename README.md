Hi, I am an AI Engineer who loves staying up to date with the latest AI trends. 

My current focus is on developing MLDL and Gen AI model inference systems with a strong emphasis on efficient inferencing using C++
and developing high-availability cloud systems and AI tools to enhance productivity.

In addition to my practical experience, I've participated in research related to AI and published a few papers on Neural Network Compression Techniques and Image Captioning Architecture for Resource-Constrained Systems.
